We will use Slack for general communication and Zoom for remote meetings. This includes ensuring another teammate is available to merge a pull request. Any urgent messages related to code will be communicated via Issues. Urgent issues will be responded to as soon as possible. Teammates will aim to respod to other messages within 24 hours.
